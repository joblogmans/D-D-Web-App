# D-D-Web-App
The GitHub for the D&amp;D Web App

This is a web app which is ment to be a D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) support for anyone to play. Everyone who is going to play is ment to connect to the main server (e.g. a RPi) using his/her phone/tablet. Eventually one should be able to connect the server to a big screen (like a TV) to display general information.
